The runtime package's DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object. (TODO: In the case where the object is of an unknown type, a runtime.Unknown object will be created and stored.) */

        /** @description `sendInitialEvents=true` may be set together with `watch=true`. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic "Bookmark" event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.
         *
         *     When `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan
         *       is interpreted as "data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`"
         *       and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced
         *       to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.
         *       If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as "consistent read" and the
         *       bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
         *       when request started being processed.
         *     - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
         *       Invalid error is returned.
         *
         *     Defaults to true if `resourceVersion=""` or `resourceVersion="0"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise. */
