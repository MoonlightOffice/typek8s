         *     The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection.

The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `"k8s.io/initial-events-end": "true"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.

         *       and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced

         *       bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment
         *       when request started being processed.
         *     - `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset
         *       Invalid error is returned.
