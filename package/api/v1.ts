If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key".

If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.
         *
         *     The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

     *
     *     	(International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
     *
     *     <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
     *
     *     	(Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
     *
     *     <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber> ```
     *
     *     No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
     *
     *     When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
     *
     *     Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
     *
     *     - No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
     *
     *     The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
     *
     *     Examples:
     *
     *     - 1.5 will be serialized as "1500m" - 1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
     *
     *     Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
     *
     *     Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
     *
     *     This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation. */
